# Customers-and-Products-Analysis-Using-SQL
It is important that a Product company extract key performance indicators (KPIs) to make smarter decisions. This saves time, resources, and money. In this project, I analyzed data from a sales record database for scale model cars and extracted information for decision-making.
A good analysis always starts with the right questions, Through this project, I want to answer the following questions
* Which products should we order more of or less of?
* How should we tailor marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?
* How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?
## Exploreing the Data Base
I used scale model cars data base and it contains 8 tables in total:
* Customers: customer data like Customer id( or serial number), Name, contact information along with Sales employee number is available.
* Employees: all the information regarding the employee is provided along with their employee id, office code, reporting manager, etc
* Offices: sales office information is available. All the offices have thier own unique code.
* Orders: customers' sales orders details like order number, customer number, dates are present
